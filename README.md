# üõµ  Zomato Delivery Data Analysis

An end-to-end data analytics project focusing on Zomato's food delivery performance using Python (EDA), SQL, and Power BI. The objective is to derive insights from the dataset to help optimize delivery operations, improve customer satisfaction, and boost efficiency.

# üéØ Aim
To analyze Zomato's food delivery data using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover patterns, bottlenecks, and key performance indicators that affect delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## ü•Ö Goals
- Perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand delivery behavior.
- Identify factors contributing to delivery delays, such as traffic, weather, or delivery type.
- Compare delivery performance across cities, time periods, and environmental conditions.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.
- Derive actionable insights to improve delivery logistics and operational planning.

# Project Components

## 1. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Key Tasks:
     - Data Cleaning (missing values, duplicates, and formatting)
     - Feature Engineering (e.g., extracting time-based features)
     - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
     - Correlation analysis
- Insights:
     - Delivery time increases during weekends and rainy weather.
     - Traffic density and type of vehicle significantly impact delivery duration.
     - Urban areas show higher order frequency but longer delivery times due to traffic congestion.
     - Road traffic density has a positive correlation with delivery time.

## 2. üõ¢Ô∏è SQL Analysis

- Tools Used: MySQL / SQL Server
- Key Tasks:
     - Created triggers to make it into 3 tables on the basis of 3 areas
     - Connected to Power BI for creating power BI Dashboard

## 3. üìà Power BI Dashboard

- Tools Used: Power BI
- Visuals Include:
    - Average delivery time by city and traffic condition
    - Impact of festivals on delivery performance
    - Delivery person ratings heatmap
    - Monthly trend of order volumes and delay percentages
- Key Dashboard Insights:
    - Delay spikes during festive seasons and peak hours
    - Suburban and semi-urban areas have fewer orders but better delivery times
    - Highest delays correlate with high traffic density and stormy weather

## üîß Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Wrangling (Python & SQL)
- EDA & Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Business Intelligence (Power BI)
- Dashboard Design and Storytelling
- Data-driven decision making

## üìå Conclusion

This project showcases how data analytics can be used to draw meaningful insights from delivery operations, helping businesses optimize resources and enhance customer satisfaction.
